# Portfolio Management Tool
This tool enables user to upload their portfolios and the system would do rest of the analysis jobs and export needed files user may need. It involves types of services like, web crawling, ETL, database design & interaction and data visualization. I made this tool when I was a personal assistant of a employee for JP. Morgan. He's my boss as well as a teacher for me.
