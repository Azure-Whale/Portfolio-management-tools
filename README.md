# Portfolio Management Tool
This tool enables user to upload their portfolios, the system would do rest of the analysis jobs and export needed files user may need. It involves types of service modules like, database(In test environment, I implement it in PostgresSQL) operation, web crawling, ETL, database design & interaction and report visualization. I was contributing to this module and tools when I was a research assistant of my Professor working on a project collerbated with a team of JP. Morgan.
